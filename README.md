# BlockyMonochromaticTheme
This is a theme.css file that I created based off the design and css I used in my Web and Mobile II (ISTE240) class during Spring Semester of Freshman Year. Feel free to use and enjoy it. It has full form, button, heading styles. Let me know if you want any more styling for something. :)

REMINDERS:
- for a logo or hamburger menu floating in the upper corners, assign an id of logo or floating button and asign them a background-image for them to apear!!!
- all content should go in an html tag <main>
        - has 80px top margin for nav space that is removed at 800px screen size
- to make an <a> link a button, use .button class
- use a .block class for a contained block with a margin
